You have little to worry about due to the nature of your relationship with a CDIC member financial institution as long as you're within insured limits. My perspective is one of facing the reality of a soured investment, not through any fault of the company but one of circumstances that are beyond their reasonable control in my opinion, though others may differ. As an equity investor for over 30 years, one thing I've learned is that denying the reality of a bad situation only leads to deeper losses. In this case I'll probably just ride it out.\n\nAs I point out in another comment, HCG GICs are currently offered at such a large premium over other financial institutions that it's a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, even if the company does eventually fail. However, I sit much higher on the acceptable risk spectrum than most and do not buy GICs so take that for what it's worth (i.e. not much!).",0

Ask around and quietly bring up a question of whether police should exercise whatever force is necessary to remove a man from his house if someone reported a prior minor alteration (which was over).  Whatever force is necessary includes killing.  Once the question is phrased in terms of a bad guy, compassion is quickly absent without serious justification of the bad label.

They just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished.\nAn objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what I state here is.\nThere is a text that I do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister Jean Pierre Voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with YBM in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story.\nI also received private mails from a mister Rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of YBMs' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of Voyer, and with links to Luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. It does not concern the Bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so.\nIt's a hobby of some sort, like some like Shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes. \nThere is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which I do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas.\nI think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis Bogdanov affair. By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.\nIt might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way.\nIt has roll this way for 2 years now, and the scenario are pretty much the same from a Forum to another.\nOne can see the same scenarios coming up, the same elements who keep coming back, the same strange behaviours at odd time, and the same surprising reactions when prooven wrong: a war take place, fill with denials, wild accusations, insults, personnal attacks, anything goes type of scenarios, with a lot of drama and tension in it, and many people getting injured, and leaving too. \nmostly those who came with the unbeatable arguments as I saw it so many times on fr. physic, from june to november 2004.\nLooking at it after without having a part of it, give the priviledged view of the whole thing in a very short period of time , in one view, and here all those flaws are very obvious and it seems estonishing that nobody noticed it at the time. The game is very clear that way, and it was clear for me that there was something wrong going on, something who wasn't right, a mismatch. \nAnd i seek after what it could be.\nIt was evident that the main person involved didn't have clean floor in his bag, and that he was hidding something but also that he was clearly lying and very """"good"""" at it, very good",0

With the rail you can reduce frequency of some country-to-town buses and use those buses as shuttles to and from the rail stations instead.  Rail cars come, I think, every 7 minutes, so if you run shuttles every 5-10 minutes during peak times the queue won't be long because everyone won't be arriving on the same shuttle.

However, all these explanations agree that a Pope who is juridically guilty of heresy can and must be removed from office. There is no dispute among Catholic theologians on this point ‚Äì even among theologians like Bellarmine who do not think that a Pope is in fact capable of being a heretic.\n            It is to be hoped that the correction of Pope Francis does not have to proceed this far, and that he will either reject the heresies he has announced or resign his office. Removing him from office against his will would require the election of a new Pope, and would probably leave the Church with Francis as an anti-Pope contesting the authority of the new Pope. If Francis refuses to renounce either his heresy or his office, however, this situation will just have to be faced.",0

Imports and exports will drop to a trickle. Mexico will go into recession but will scramble to make up by pushing trade with its other countries which it has free trade packs including the EU. No more Mexico oil to the U.S. \n\nThe U.S. will also take a big hit. Corporate profits will drop like a stone due to expensive imports and loss of consumer buying power. Long term Mexico will be OK because it is not a rich country and its people can take a hit. America will have a hell of a time trying to get anybody to sign or renew trade agreements with it.

Inst. C.E., Adviser to the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works.  He also exercised control over the carrying out of the work until his retirement from the Egyptian Government Service in 1921.\nThe consulting engineers were the late Sir A. L. Webb, M. Inst.

C.E., was appointed resident engineer in 1914, followed by Mr. E. W. Buckley from 1914 to 1917. The Author has held that office from 1917 to the present date.\nThe contractors from 1919 to 1922 were the Sudan Construction  Company (Messrs. E. Alessandrini and G. S. Perry, M. Inst. C.E.).  From 1922 to the completion Messrs. S. Pearson and Son,  Ltd., carried out the work. Their director in charge was Sir Frederick T. Hopkinson, M. Inst. CE., the agent in charge being Mr. J. W. Gibson.\nThe sub-contractors for the supply and erection of the sluice steelwork were Messrs. Ransomes and Rapier, Ltd., of Ipswich, their engineer in charge being Mr. J. R.

This factors into the fact that we have roughly 200,000 tourists here at any given point in time that are totally dependent on us taking care of them if something happens. 200,000 people with NO 14 day food supply.\nTHEN, In addition, many of the warehouses are in flood inundation zones, so if a Tsunami hit and took out the warehouses, then we only have a 4 day food supply in the state.\n\nYes, YOU better have your own!",0

I'm of the opinion that we wouldn't have as strong a constitution if such machinery were in place then. Even when I was a kid growing up in North Dakota there were at least five parties in play: Democrat, Republican, Non-Partisan League, Independent Voter's League and Democratic Socialist Party. Also, at that time, the major parties were not as monolithic as they are today. There was more distribution of different approaches and philosophies and more cross-party coalitions based on the matter at hand. I'd take it one step further than Mr. Bloom. I'd like to see the same happen to the Democratic Party. And I mean no disrespect to either my good republican or my good democrat friends when I say that.",0

I don't believe that increased interest rates will have any major impact on utilities ability to pay their dividends. Ergo, I just look at it as a potential buying opportunity.",1

Theses people are in the low end of rich or very high end of middle, and they need to pay for living in Canada; the right to vote, medical coverage, good water et all; it is time.

Crimea is where the British and French fought the Russians in the Crimean war from 1853 to 1856.\n\nFor years, the Ukrainian government have threatened to cancel the lease at Sevastopol and have the Black Sea Fleet evicted unless they got more money. The threat is to offer it to the West as a NATO naval base.\n\nWhen the Ukrainian government was overthrown in 2014, the new government made a mistake of announcing that Russian military forces would have to leave Crimea.

Many knowledgable people now say his opinions on the AAA have pretty much slammed the door on employee and consumer access to the courts.  In my personal view, Justice Scalia was a radical activist judge.  Not saying that's a bad thing, but please, let's call a spade a spade.

Chicago, for example, has an insane murder rate in the poor neighborhoods and a very low rate in middle class and wealthy neighborhoods.

Silvers were the most valuable fish commercially, but the family preferred to eat chums-canned, dried, oiled, and fresh during the warmer months.  During the winter we put nets under the ice and caught 3 kinds of whitefish, burbot, pike, shee fish and a few chums and silvers.   White fish and pike were popular frozen, dried, fried, baked and occasionally fermented.  Kings were popular baked and dried. We usually ate or sold 40 to 50 kings.  Yukon lings were preferred eating.  Yukon friends would gift them to us. All kings were considered very rich food and frankly and were popular only during early summer.   We quickly tired of the rich fish.  Chums and white fish were everyone's favorite.   We feed ourselves, kids, visitors, neighbors, the poor and bereaved.  We salted 40 gallons  chums and silvers in wooden barrels and these were sent to bereaved families.",1

Yes, it has a nice picuture of Savia in 900AD, which would be Braslav's Greater Duchy. Thehistory of Pannonia region is more vague than others. From what I have understood: \n\n *Initially Lower Pannonia referred to south of the Drava, ie """"Croatian Pannonia"""". After Liutevid's revolt, Louis the German re-organized the Frankish eastern Marches (Carinthia, Lower Pannonia, Upper Pannonia, Carniola). He rotated the borders of L and U Pannonia 90'. Ie, the border line now ran through the Raab river in NW Hungary, so that it would fit the ecclesiastical borders b/w Salzburg and Passau. Upper Pannonia was what became Ostmark, ie northern Austria. Lower Pannonia is exactly where Balaton Principality is - ie b/w the Raab, Danube and Drava rivers according to Goldberg (who wrote a book on the rule of Louis the German). The New cambridge Medieval History extend this border to the Sava. So the rulers we know in the area are: \n\n *Vojnomir- who heled the Franks in c. 800 against the Avars \n * Liutevid (910-823) \n * Ratimir sometime in the 830s, who was expelled by Ratbod. \n Then nothing, no ruler mentioned. Perhaps during this the Savia (Croatia b/s Sava and Rava) was ruled by Ratbod directly, or maybe by Pribina and Kotsel from their center in Blatnograd. Not until 894, when Kotsel dies we here of Braslav, poor guy only got to rule for 5 years before those nasty Magyars came and caused trouble.    \n\n """,0

30695,Focusing too much attention on gun laws while failing to deal with important underlying problems has proved to leave us with more problems rather than fewer.  When Reagan was shot gun control was the first response.  At the same time people were released from mental institutions and funding for community mental health was cut.\nMass killing are frequently associated with suicide. Suicide attempts and other forms of self-destructive cause much suffering and some deaths.  Both community mental health and education can help prevent more serious outcomes.\nWhen Columbine happened I hoped that educational practices would be changed instead of a focus on gun control.\nThings like mass killings and suicides have a certain contagious aspect.  Amok behavior was reported in an area of the South Pacific in the 1800s that seemed to be a part of that culture. If we care about real improvement the conversation must go beyond gun control.,0

Or do you just have it all, brains, looks, white skin, strong religious following, money, and a job at a nice multinational corporation.  Well let me give you a heads up.  I am wealthy and well off too, but there is no need to flaunt or even protect our own money.  In fact the life we have lived should be enough happiness for us.  We shouldn't be always asking for more more more.  We need to learn to find time and space to say """"that's enough for me, please help my fellow man"""".  Your strong attitude towards Conservatives and especially the Republicans tells me many things:\n1)  You don't believe in second chances\nmy comment is how can you not believe in second chances when the previous president Bush was a lazy drunk for a 1/3 of his life.  How can you not give a child who has never had a supportive dad, a clean mom, or a stable neighborhood to grow up on a second chance?  How can you not give a 16 year old girl who accidently got pregnant a second chance to live a normal life, rather than have an unwanted child who will never get the same love and support if it were to be born to a responsible parent?\n2)  You hate or have no apathy for the poor\nmy comment is how can you have the poor and absolutely abhor any programs that help them if you have never been there yourself.  What would a rich upper class fellow like you know what its like to be starving and homeless on the streets of NYC or Miami after you have served your country in 2 different wars?

Show me where in the bible it said to take slaves out of the poor, black, and under privleged to feed the desires of the rich.  You talk about the bible so much, you forget the inherent meaning and underlying purpose for it. It was written to teach you """"how to live and what rules to follow"""" not how not to rules and what rules to break.  I sincerely hope there is a hell for you and all you rich, white republicans who have never helped anyone besides themselves in life will end up.\n\nGod bless your poor rotting soul.

In over 80% of THOSE cases, the police and the prosecuting attorneys KNEW (this is not anything that can be argued- these are just facts) that they were going to KILL an innocent person.

We tended to hire the good ones in the next year or two after they graduated. It worked out well for everyone and it sounds like this company is approaching it the same way.\n\nBut I've also been with a large Canadian company that handled co-ops as a complete after thought. Managers had the attitude that they were being saddled with them. It reflected much of how the company was managed overall. Its spectacular flame-out in the 2000's (you know who it is) didn't surprise anyone who had worked there.\n\nSo if you're going to take on co-ops do it right.,1

I complained to customer service because it is important for AkAir to know that they have employees who are not following through on what they are promising customers. Nobody wants to sit between two Sumo wrestlers for a 3.5 hour flight and especially with bad shoulders which is why I always try to get a window or aisle seat. In my letter to AkAir I told them it was not the service I was used to from the company and especially the confrontational attitude at the service counter. Told them it smacked of the United Airlines bad attitude and I hoped they could do something about it. If you don't take care of bad service it will go on and on doncha think?,0

They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.\n\nMore attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.\n\nThey they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.",0
31807,"""  \n\n :Yes, I am sure G.Khan existed. We have many sources for that, from friends and enemies, although I doubt he was a member of the CP. Jesus, as well, is referred to outside of the Bible by contemporary Roman sources, who would not be biased toward making the guy up. But that aside, you and I aren't going to see eye to eye on much of theissues raised, so let's just stop arguing about it.  \n\n I still believe your list is fraught with problems and offer two quick illustrations:  \n\n *Walter Bernstein is listed as one with a """"covert relationship"""" with the USSR, yet this is based solely on one Venona cable that has """"Khan"""" stating Bernstein would file a report when he """"returns from his trip,"""" which involved a journey into German held Yugoslavia for an interview with Tito he was doing for Yank magazine (Hardly a left magazine of any sort). The identity of """"Khan"""" remains unknown (not Ghengis), Bernsteing does not even have a codename,the relationship between the two remains unknown, and neither the FBI or the NSA identify Bernstein as an agent of any kind. So, aside from K&H;'s assertion, on what basis would you include his name? This is just one example of K&H; slandering a man simply because his name is mentioned.  \n\n *Donald Hiss is another, and although his name does not appear in Venona, your intro to the names makes it appear that it does. The sole accusations against Hiss rest with Chambers, and later, one mention by a fellow named Rushmore, which never led anywhere. The FBI files on Donald run from 1942 to 1957, He was extensively investigated on all aspects of the charges (you can check this yourself by going to FBI.gov and clicking on the FOIA tab). The investigation was first closed in 1952 with the FBI referring to Chambers' allegations as """"unsubstantiated"""" and stating that there had been """"no allegations of espionage at any time."""" The case was then reopened for a perjury investigation as Donald had testfied under oath that he had not been any time a member of the Party, or any affiliated group, in any way, shape or form, nor had he ever known Chambers at any time. That investigation extended over the next several years and not one of the FBI's party source had ever heard of D. Hiss, other than from coverage of his brother's trial. Donald was never charged with perjury, nor is there any indication in the published files that the FBI thought he should be.  He was then investgated again concerning resurfaced charges Chambers had made concerning the first Harry Bridges deportation case. Again, the allegation led nowhere. The link to his name lists him as a member of the Ware group, but the FBI could not substantiate that. Lee Pressman (another name that should be removed, but later on that), who testified willingly, stated that he had been in the Ware group and the party for about a year and a half during the period cited by Chambers, and that neither Hiss brother was involved as far as he knew. Nathanial Weyl testfied as well that Donald was not a member. So, again, why is his name listed, other than K&H;'s assertion which appears to be based solely on Chambers'assertion, which the FBI calls """"unsubstantiated""""? As for suggesting different language for the names, that's fine with me, I'll try to come up with something later, its kinda late now.Grif  \n\n  \n\n """,0

Very simply, I think the idea of justification is suspect, and not without reason. While it's true that millennials often opt for what Bonhoefer called cheap grace, it's also true that justification by faith/grace was a Pauline preoccupation that can't easily be traced back to the gospels. Today's young Catholics don't take it for granted that they're sinners, that God is offended by their actions, or that God could only have been appeased by the sacrifice of his son. On a list of ideas we won't find people discussing in our churches, ""substitutionary atonement"" would be near the top. In my view, the churches won't regain their ability to speak to this generation until they come up with a new reason why believing in God through Jesus is better than not believing. I'm not sure we can articulate that at the moment.",0

In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.\n\nSo I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.\n\nAnyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun.

Don&#8217;t believe it.</p> \n<p>Evidence shows she left the State Department in shambles and our nation weaker. Her record at Foggy Bottom disqualifies her to be president.</p> \n<p>Her failures go beyond leaving four Americans to die in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the ridiculous Russian &#8220;reset&#8221; and the carnage in Syria that she and President Obama idly watched unfold &#8212; and that gets more horrific daily.</p> \n<p>A string of investigative reports from the Obama administration shows that she botched key management jobs as secretary of state, threatening American lives and our diplomatic secrets.</p> \n<p>Clinton&#8217;s State Department repeatedly rebuffed requests for additional security for the vulnerable compound at Benghazi, Libya. The result? Heavily armed terrorists were able to storm the compound and kill Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.</p> \n<p>But Benghazi wasn&#8217;t an isolated case. Clinton failed to secure diplomatic posts in Pakistan, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and other global hot spots. Internal State Department reports show the posts lacked emergency plans in case of attack. Guards assigned to them had no training in chemical or biological threats and, amazingly, some hadn&#8217;t undergone background checks.</p> \n<p>Clinton tried to weasel out of taking the blame for Benghazi, testifying to Congress that she wasn&#8217;t personally involved in embassy security. But emails later revealed that was false.</p> \n<p>Investigators also point to Clinton&#8217;s total neglect of cybersecurity. The Bush administration &#8212; reeling from the attack on the World Trade Center &#8212; had made it a top priority to protect information flow among embassies, the CIA and the FBI.</p> \n<p>But Clinton dropped the ball, creating what the department&#8217;s inspector general called &#8220;undue risk in the management of information.&#8221;</p> \n<p>In November 2013, the IG issued an alert to the State Department&#8217;s top executives about the urgent &#8220;recurring weaknesses&#8221; in cybersecurity that had been red-flagged in six previous reports between 2011 and 2013, almost all on Clinton&#8217;s watch. The &#8220;recurring weaknesses&#8221; had still not been addressed, including vulnerabilities to hackers.</p> \n<p>One of those previous reports &#8212; from July 2013 (shortly after Clinton&#8217;s departure) &#8212; described how much of the cybersecurity work was actually being done by contractors rather than department staff, contrary to government policy.</p> \n<p>John Bentel, in charge of State&#8217;s cybersecurity during Clinton&#8217;s tenure, is one of the five State Department staffers who demanded immunity before talking to FBI investigators about Clinton&#8217;s private-server scheme.</p> \n<p>He apparently took his duties regarding Clinton&#8217;s secret server more seriously than his duties to safeguard national cybersecurity. According to an IG report, Bentel &#8220;instructed his subordinates not to discuss the secretary&#8217;s email.&#8221;</p> \n<p>Rudy Giuliani said on Saturday Clinton&#8217;s use of a private email service for official business was like taking &#8220;all our top-secret material and throwing it out on Fifth Avenue.&#8221;</p> \n<p>Outrageous, but still a lesser offense than Clinton&#8217;s neglect of the entire department&#8217;s digital security &#8212; exposing communications between thousands of agents and diplomats across the globe. Even after WikiLeaks released 250,000 confidential State Department documents in 2010, Clinton didn&#8217;t plug the obvious holes in State&#8217;s cyber setup.</p> \n<p>Yet during Monday&#8217;s debate, Clinton had the nerve to claim that she takes threats to the nation&#8217;s cybersecurity very seriously. That&#8217;s a laugh.</p> \n<p>Hillary&#8217;s management of finances at State was also slipshod, according to inspector general reports that point to a whopping $6 billion unaccounted for during her tenure. Clinton&#8217;s chaotic mismanagement created &#8220;conditions conducive to fraud,&#8221; the IG warned, and made it harder &#8220;to punish and deter criminal behavior.&#8221; She must have felt right at home.</p> \n<p>True to Clinton&#8217;s instinct to cover up problems rather than fix them, she thwarted several investigations of sexual misconduct and prostitution at State. Investigators complained of &#8220;an appearance of undue influence and favoritism.&#8221;</p> \n<p>So what are the odds Hillary would run the federal government with integrity, keep the nation safe and get taxpayers more for their money?

This problem could easily be remedied by allowing for the adoptive parent to be listed on the birth cert and thus not imposing this legal fiction of ""virgin birth"" the child, but recognizing the parents who are taking legal responsibility for meeting the child's needs. The SCOTUS' decision in Obergefell, based in religious law, does allow marriage to trump the child's right to know the identity of his/her genetic parents; this also allows children born to single mothers to be denied this information - and to be denied any responsibility of fathers for meeting their needs.",0

6960,"""\n\n NASA Study Debunks Part of Global Warming \nNASA Sees Arctic Ocean Circulation Do an About-Face\nNovember 13, 2007\n\nPASADENA, Calif. ‚Äì A team of NASA and university scientists has detected an ongoing reversal in Arctic Ocean circulation triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade-long time scales. The results suggest not all the large changes seen in Arctic climate in recent years are a result of long-term trends associated with global warming.\n\nThe team, led by James Morison of the University of Washington's Polar Science Center Applied Physics Laboratory, Seattle, used data from an Earth-observing satellite and from deep-sea pressure gauges to monitor Arctic Ocean circulation from 2002 to 2006. They measured changes in the weight of columns of Arctic Ocean water, from the surface to the ocean bottom. That weight is influenced by factors such as the height of the ocean's surface, and its salinity. A saltier ocean is heavier and circulates differently than one with less salt.\n\nThe very precise deep-sea gauges were developed with help from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the satellite is NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace). The team of scientists found a 10-millibar decrease in water pressure at the bottom of the ocean at the North Pole between 2002 and 2006, equal to removing the weight of 10 centimeters (four inches) of water from the ocean. The distribution and size of the decrease suggest that Arctic Ocean circulation changed from the counterclockwise pattern it exhibited in the 1990s to the clockwise pattern that was dominant prior to 1990.\n\nReporting in Geophysical Research Letters, the authors attribute the reversal to a weakened Arctic Oscillation, a major atmospheric circulation pattern in the northern hemisphere. The weakening reduced the salinity of the upper ocean near the North Pole, decreasing its weight and changing its circulation.\n\n""""Our study confirms many changes seen in upper Arctic Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature, rather than trends caused by global warming,"""" said Morison.\n\n""""While some 1990s climate trends, such as declines in Arctic sea ice extent, have continued, these results suggest at least for the 'wet' part of the Arctic  the Arctic Ocean  circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s,"""" he added.\n\nThe Arctic Oscillation was fairly stable until about 1970, but then varied on more or less decadal time scales, with signs of an underlying upward trend, until the late 1990s, when it again stabilized. During its strong counterclockwise phase in the 1990s, the Arctic environment changed markedly, with the upper Arctic Ocean undergoing major changes that persisted into this century. Many scientists viewed the changes as evidence of an ongoing climate shift, raising concerns about the effects of global warming on the Arctic.\n\nMorison said data gathered by Grace and the bottom pressure gauges since publication of the paper earlier this year highlight how short-lived the ocean circulation changes can be. The newer data indicate the bottom pressure has increased back toward its 2002 level. """"The winter of 2006-2007 was another high Arctic Oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum,"""" he said. """"It is too early to say, but it looks as though the Arctic Ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again.""""\n\nMorison cautioned that while the recent decadal-scale changes in the circulation of the Arctic Ocean may not appear to be directly tied to global warming, most climate models predict the Arctic Oscillation will become even more strongly counterclockwise in the future. """"The events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the Arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world,"""" he said.\n\nGrace monitors tiny month-to-month changes in Earth's gravity field caused primarily by the movement of water in Earth's land, ocean, ice and atmosphere reservoirs. As such it can infer changes in the weight of columns of ocean water. In contrast, the pressure gauges installed on the sea floor in 2005-2006 directly measured water pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Gauge data were remotely recovered during the first year of the study.\n\n""""The close agreement between the North Pole pressure gauges and Grace data demonstrates Grace's potential for tracking world ocean circulation,"""" said study co-author John Wahr of the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\n""""Satellite altimeters, such as NASA's Jason, are ideal for studying ocean circulation but can't be used at Earth's poles due to ice cover,"""" said study co-author Ron Kwok of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.

I do not think this fact is disputed unless there is a fringe view of what is means to be a Christian, which excludes other forms. I do not think this can be excluded as a form of Christianity without committing some basic problems in logic in regards to this definition, in particular the No True Scotsman fallacy. Until you have a good source that not only makes the case but represents the scholarly consensus on the question of a definition of Christianity that is sufficiently inclusive but still exclusive of PC as one of its manifestations of the religion, we do not get to delete the factual statement that PC is a form of Christianity. At most we can state that it is disputed, which Giovanni has done. It does not make any claim regarding the compatibility of Christianity with Nazism, but it does say that PC is a form of Christianity that is consistent with Nazism. If you dispute this, then please state what part parts of PC are not consistent with Nazism as an ideology?

It causes friction with the more controlling, rule-oriented, structured, cautious,  closed-system conservatism.  This is true not just in religion, but in every area of human endeavor.  Every single institution in the developed world (and we are now seeing it in developing countries as well) has gone through the same period of reorientation and renewal as the Catholic Church has.

Jesus didn't tell Peter to put away his sword out of dislike of violence (although he does condemn unjustified violence, not violence in self-defense).   He told Peter to put away his sword because He did not want any interference with his mission --- to go to the cross --- and wanted to impress that fact on Peter.  \n\nAs for Jesus telling the apostles to go buy swords.  There is no reasonable way to explain this except as an endorsement of the use of arms in self-defense.  One poster here says Jesus was speaking figuratively.  Ludicrous.  Why would Jesus expect the apostles to take him figuratively?  Did Jesus ever correct the apostles for taking him literally?  Seeing them come back with swords, he surely would have, if he had meant his words only figuratively.  \n\nMaybe the guy who thinks Jesus should be taken figuratively is dyslexic, and misread the passage to say, ""Go sell your cloaks and buy words.""",0

Of all the ancient Eucharistic Rites, the Roman Rite is the only one to undergo recent radical change.\nThe pre-Conciliar Daily Missals provided English translations of the Latin texts which were quite comprehensible, dignified and sacral. God was addressed as 'Thou' because the more familiar form 'You' had long ceased to replace it as the second person singular.

Municipal offenders are a separate set of beds or even separate facilities in the case of Springfield, JC, CG or Florence. Muni offenders are not part of the capacity based release stats. The capacity based releases are counted only those that are charged by the DA as those released without charges in not coounted in that statistic. The DA is not staffed at a level to charge folks with low level crimes so if you are on the list of capacity based releases, you did something pretty significant. Certainly, not shop lifting. If you really want to know, it is just a matter of making a public records request but that might not support your premise.",0

According to the BBC  JFS ""remains dominant in Idlib in the north-west of Syria"" and that is where most of the anti-Assad forces are concentrated. They are regarded as the most combat effective fighters among the rebel ranks. There is a border between Idlib and Turkey. Weapons have been flowing across aided by the Turks.

16334,""":::The core problem is that all such references are explicitly in the context of delusional parasitosis (e.g.), and the reason the various skin treatments DP sufferers attempt are ineffective is because it's a psychiatric condition and not a skin condition; since the mainstream medical community does not accept Morgellons, nothing is being published in the context of Morgellons as a legitimate dermatological condition, and presumably never will be. Nearly all of the """"scientific commentary"""", in other words, is - if you want to be truly NPOV about it - impossible to include here. If no one outside the MRF accepts the existence of Morgellons, then no one is going to comment on the efficacy of treatments FOR Morgellons, are they? It's called a """"Catch-22"""". That is """"a situation in which multiple probabilistic events exist, and the desirable outcome results from the confluence of these events, but there is zero probability of this happening, as they are mutually exclusive."""" The mutually exclusive events in this case are that a reputable medical author(s) will publish in a reputable medical journal AND that this publication will happen to be a refutation of a fringe medical theory which both the author(s) and the journal editors reject so completely as to give it no credence whatsoever. Ain't gonna happen any time soon. It might be different if the pro-Morgellons folks ever came up with any clinical studies or other actual evidence for their claims, but in the absence of such, what reputable journal is going to give space to refuting completely unsupported fringe theories? Professionals don't usually waste their time arguing against theories which have zero supporting evidence. That's generally not how science (or medicine) operates. The one hope we have is that the CDC will eventually complete their investigation, and issue a public statement. Of course, one can easily predict the pro-Morgellons community will claim it's a government cover-up, but at least we'll have something else authoritative we can quote for inclusion in this article, instead of relying so heavily upon magazines and newspapers.    \n\n """,0

You also placed the new addition at the top of the section, and the placement is very odd because if you really want to compromise with me, you should've made a group to Fujimura, the other archaeological case and the science case.

Species ranging from nonhuman primates, dogs, and rabbits to mice and rats are subjected to painful procedures without the benefit of pain medication. In traumatic brain injury studies, which inflict excruciating head injuries on mice, most published studies do not list any form of analgesia. When pain medication is given, it is often insufficient. For example, in sepsis experiments, where abdominal surgeries are performed to induce severe infections, mice may be given just one dose of post-surgical analgesia, which is woefully inadequate for the agony of this condition. Pain management protocols often consider the convenience of the experimenters above the animal's discomfort. Sadly, the current oversight system that Dr. Collins praises so highly fails in its mandate to protect animals from unnecessary pain and suffering.",0

Eventually, if they survive a couple of seasons, they gain enough familiarity with vehicles, that they can sort of cope with them. \nPeople who have lived in the bush, or at least hunted many years, usually develop the ability to be able to ""see"", and even smell or hear the wild animals that live there.\nThey were there, all around you.

I do not know the details because I was never told much, but it was resolved. There were a few men around that the common word was to be careful with at the time. They were single men in the community who had their own extended families. They were working class and had very limited mobility to leave the community. My father was the school principal of a middle school. I now realize that he had to deal with a ""problem"" unmarried 6th grade male tenured teacher.

There is no cause or reason to put more restrictions or security requirements on marijuana production than there are on tobacco production, and I can buy rolling tobacco in 200 gram cans for forty cents a gram, all taxes included.",0

Its very dangerous to have organised & armed people who dont accept your leadership , inside your land .

After the defeat of Quraish , there were so much delegations from all over the region to accept Islam ( by their own freewill ) that the year is called san-al wofood ( the year of delegations ). \n\n :::3 . Well ....this is a difficult one . Mainly b/c this problem was encountered only in India , & even in India there arnt much buddhists . You might find the books by some scholars in India ,  one very well known scholar hasbeen Abul Kalam Azad .Hs studied the hindu/buddh scriptures & practices for a long time . He said that the non-abrahamic faith R alo divine . There isnt any thing said by Ram , Krishna or Buddha that is against core Islamic beliefs . Secondly there R many prophecies in these scriptures about Muhamad  , so they cant be human made . And so people following these religions should be considered as people of the book , not pagans .  \n\n :::There R many scholars who say that the word Dhul Kifl used in Quran is not Ezkeel but Buddha . Because the word Dhul means having/belonging , & Kifl is actually arabianised form ( there is no P sound in arabic ) of Kipl ,  or kipl vastav. So the word Dhul-Kifl means belonging to Kipl Vastav . Also in another verse God has sworn by four very honourable things . Makkah ( associated with Muhammad), Mount of Sina ( Associated with Moses ), olive ( associated with Jesus ), & fig ( supposed to be associated with Buddha ).  \n\n :::This is not accepted by all scholars though , but well , accepted by many . Main reason behind non-acceptance is that these things arnt explained clearly in Quran , the political conflicts b/w hindus & muslims , & b/c when muslims came to India ... U can say that the soul of Islam wasent that much strong . Otherwise there was a possibility that like zorasterans , buddhists/hindus would also havebeen declared people of the book . \n\n  \n :::Gren , Afghanistan has not been a country for like 30 years .Different parts of it havebeen ruled by Pushtoons , Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmens, Persian influenced , Soviets , & now America .

BUT it could only be one party arrested, not both. In other words the police had to ""believe"" one party or the other - no neutrality allowed. I assume most people already leapt ahead to the predictable conclusion: it was virtually always being the man who was arrested.\nSuddenly there are huge numbers of arrests being made. The ""perp"" is always a male.

As for Blair, he christened the party 'New Labour' and very clearly articulated he/it was neo-liberal centrist. \n\nMitterrand is a different story. As leader of the Socialist party he did make a sudden u-turn after 2 years on many economic issues. And while at first he resisted the European community because he viewed as merely the creation of a free trade zone but he caved. That was indeed a betrayal. \n\nThe story of globalism founded on the reductionist idea of free trade and corporate influence is the story of neo-liberalism not the ""left"".

3937,"""\n\nTHIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:\n\nNicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,\n\nYou have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.\n\nMay I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.\n\nThere is a constant undermining of the city¬¥s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.\n\nThe Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.\n\nIt is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.\n\nThis is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.\n\nIn the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.\n\nMarcobadotti (talk) """,0

The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time.""\n\nThis shows as good an example of the value of a scientific theory as one might find:  ""offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena.""",0

In the U.S. 32 percent of computer science graduates are not employed in information technology due to a lack of jobs (U.S. Dept of Labor - Monthly Labor Review May 2015).

I did almost no editing on Tuesday and none on Wednesday, so it has taken me sometime to catch up, hence the delay in responding to you. \n\n Over nearly nine days, I spent the best part of three days reading that article from end to end, at least twice and I made a conscientious effort to read every word, plus checking the references, etc. Both times, I read the Lede (or WP:Lead) last. I must have been """"tired"""" and missed those problems that you have found in the Lede. So, thanks for highlighting them. They are easy to fix, I'll probably get round to it after Christmas, as I have another three reviews currently under way. You are welcome to fix it yourself if you are so inclined. \n\n You make the comment """"I couldn't find anywhere any description of the man"""", well yes that is true. As point of interest: one of my second great grandfathers was born in about 1830, he joined the British army and fought in the Crimean war: and I am unable to answer any of these questions of yours (Was he dark-haired? Blond? Tall? Fat? Joyful? Intelligent? Stupid? Rude?) in respect of him, or his wife (Irish, I believe) or two of his children who were born and died in the United States of the Ionian Islands. His eldest son fought in the Second Boer War and I have his army record, so I can tell you the colour of his eyes, his chest measurement, his height and his complexion, but I don't know whether he was Fat, Joyful, Intelligent, Stupid, Rude, neither do I have a picture of him. I do have a picture of his wife, my great grandmother, who died in 1928, but I have no idea whether she was Joyful, Intelligent, Stupid, or Rude. \n\n We do know exactly what an artist thought San Mart√≠n looked like in 1829 or 1827, since there is a painting of him. Here is a copy  You will also find it in the article on the top right hand side of the article. Based on that, we can rule out blond and fat. He does not appear to look stupid or rude. \n\n I find your comments Well, the article should be at most B, certainly not a GA, unless the standards are very low nowadays... somewhat offensive. Since September, 2008 I've reviewed 467 new WP:GANs including three of your nominations: Legacy of Pedro II of Brazil, Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil and Early life of Pedro II of Brazil, in 2010, perhaps more, all of which I passed; and I also reviewed 46 articles that had been made a GA prior to 26 August 2007 (details can be found at Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps). Many of the GAs passed prior to 2007 would not be regarded as GA-material under the current rules: I failed about 15 percent of what I reviewed in Sweeps, other reviewers failed perhaps 40 percent. \n\n If you still consider that Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is only B-class and my reviewing standards are low then refer that article to WP:GAR. Likewise, I suggest that you also refer your three articles back to WP:GAR. I will caution you that of the (more than) 500) GANs that I've reviewed only two, so far, have been referred back to WP:GAR. One that I failed twice was also failed at GAR and one that I passed at GAN was subsequently failed, so even if you do get Jos√© de San Mart√≠n failed, it will only be the second review of mine to be overturned, so I shan't lose any sleep over it. I doubt also whether your two articles would be down graded to B's. I understand that Early life of Pedro II of Brazil was for WP:FAC, I see that you never submitted it. \n   """,1

Also since you can live in Manoa and seldom leave the valley, the elderly (my parents among them) can live independently in their houses later into their lives.  \n\nAccording to Oahu Re there are only 8 homes for sale right now in the entire valley and only 26 sold or in escrow all year. Compare this to Palolo (which is half the size of Manoa) which also has 8 homes on the market, but 51 homes either sold or in escrow this year.  Low inventory of course also drives up price, which means the people who can afford those homes that do go to market will be older.  There is, also, no place to build new houses.\n\nI would expect Manoa to start getting younger in a decade or so as the homes built in the 60s start getting passed down to the next generation.",0

Empowered I finished my B.S. degree, pursued a career in technical communication. Exclusionary and abusive environments limit academic and career choice.

Either way, one of us is going to have to adapt.  In this case, it's our British (and Commonwealth) cousins; in other cases, it's the Americans.  It's not worth complaining about.    \nWikipedia:Manual of Style says, """"The English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language. No variety is more correct than the others. Users are asked to take into account that the differences between the varieties are superficial."""", and says, """"When either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for an editor to change an article from one style to another unless there is a substantial reason to do so (for example, it is acceptable to change from American to British spelling if the article concerns a British topic).""""  See also Wikipedia:Manual of Style (spelling).    \n\n Feral Dogs \nSomething about what is said about feral dogs in the article doesn't match with observations on feral dogs. Actually it doesn't even match with some articles in wikipedia. E.G. the Dingo is a feral dog too and they are excellent hunters, as well as the Carolina Dogs, who even seem to have some unique hunting skills. It's also wrong to assume that feral dog packs lack the social structure of wolf packs, you should browse for """"Tuscany Dog Project"""" (thats a study concerning this topic) and the dogs there, although not completely feral, have a very complex social structure in their pack (check the german version of wikipedia if you like, there's a full article). Also wolves don't form packs on general, in Italy and in Germany as well many packs only consist of the parents, their current litter, and the litter of the last year. In Italy, there are many solitary wolves and many who only live in pairs, as well as quite a few packs of feral and semi-feral dogs who can hunt prey wolves aren't capable of and who are competing or interacting with wolves (depends on the situation). So all in all feral dogs aren't that poor.168.224.32.15  \n\nThe dingo has had thousands of years to revert back to a semi-ativistic state. Domestic dogs havent had that amount of time to become fully fledged wild animals.\n\nWhile domestic dogs do form packs, there is little monogamy, cooperative hunting, or mutual puppy care.129.12.200.49  \n\nIn all cases? If known cases of adoption, care for puppies by aunts (I admit, there is no prove for care by males), monogamy and cooperative hunting. As a matter of fact, these things aren't as common among wolves as most people think. Don't you think, you generalize to much?\nE.G. Erik Zimen (a famous cynologist in Europe) witnessed no monogamy in his poodle group. Observations by Eberhard Trummler and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas came to different results (the first observed dingo/wolf/dog-mixes and the latter Sibirian Huskies), as well as Guenther Bloch in his studies in Italy (two groups and one pack of near-feral dogs, mostly or entirely mongrels). You should keep in mind, that there isn't much data concerning this topic and it wouldn't be the first time that an observer didn't really observe and just judged by what he/she already thought to be true. Remember, for a long time people thought, that wolves would generally form packs with an alpha on the top and an omega on the bottom of the pack or that dogs would always search the nearness of humans, because """"they are born that way"""". Both """"Facts"""" have been proven to be wrong since at least the 80's, although they are still in the mind of many people.  \n\nLaughter in dogs?\nIt seems like the whole paragraph was POV and/or derived from unreliable sources, so I commented it out for now.\n\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dog&diff;=189737773&oldid;=189712071\n\n  \n\n Dangerous substances \n\nOther than the danger of toxoplasmosis from eating cat feces, does any real harm result from dogs eating feces?

37982,"Me thinks you confuse private prayer with public communal liturgy. Sure internal preparation helps, but in communal worship, the shared external experience is very important. The purpose of getting the externals right--good music, lustily sung mostly by the congregation; carefully prepared, articulated, proclamation of the word; preaching the probes deep into the meaning of the Word; reverent processions, Eucharistic prayer, distribution of the Eucharist respecting the clear Divine command to both eat and drink--is to elevate all of the spirits present to a deeper internal experience of our communal union with the Divine. \n\nBut of course, if one craves the private devotion at mass fostered in the 1950s, then one may well not care much for the communal liturgy (which incidentally is what the Greek word means) where externals matter. One can always drift off into private piety, where good externals might be experienced as disruptive.",1

The church established Union Conferences to confirm structurally that the men serving as General Conference officers  did not have personal authority over the work of the church in congregations and in conferences.\n\nWomen's ordination is like God's grace when it flooded the Seventh-day Adventist church 1888.

Please care to search on e.g. YouTube (see, let us say, this page) and notice that there are Americans who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing """"security reasons"""" as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever denied September 11 happening, however there are some who question the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film The Ziggurat Goddess (about which here), 2004, with Shahab Hosseini in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed.

If the alternative is a regular roof for $10k, then a cheap $10k shingle roof will only last around 20 - 25 years in Cali.  So you've got around $14k in roofing costs over that 30-year period time.  The net cost of the solar feature is then $20k.\n\nYou're looking at the utility bill savings that this $20k gives you versus putting it in an investment.  $76,700 is the amount of savings given in the article.  What kind of return do you need on the $20k to get $76.7k after 30 years? Answer = 4.6%, AFTER TAX.  Still, if you can achieve your 6% after tax on the investment account then, yes, you would be better off investing the $20k.  But there are two big problems here: (a) 6% after tax is closer to 10% gross return, a difficult feat to achieve these days, and (b) the risk profiles of the two are completely different.  A better comparison is a 30-year US gov bond: 3.0%. I'd take the solar.",0

I think the triggering of DPD is like where someone gets really stoned either a s aonce off or a period of use or takes LSD or psylocibin a couple of times or once and then triggers depersonalisation disorder. I guess I am coming from the perspective or depersonalisation caused by a chronic insult to the nervous system, i.e. severe distortion of brain chemistry due to chronic dependence (upregulation, down regulation of transmitter systems) and/or from withdrawal. For example I have never heard of someone going and getting drunk and then waking up the next day with (triggered) depersonalisation or some other major mental health disorder but I have heard and it is well known that alcohol dependence and misuse over a prolonged period of time can cause a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Infact I was talking to a psychiatrist and he said that the most common causes of depersonalisation like symptoms that he sees in his practice is either from cannabis or the consequences of alcoholism and he says as far as alcoholism he has seen people recover after up to 10 years of abstinence or in some cases never. He works with a lot of people who have mental health problems from drug abuse and/or dependence. There is no ill feeling at all from my point of view.

If anyone is implying racism it is you because your reaction suggests you think criticism of head coaches needs to be based on skin color.\n\nBy the way, last football season I questioned / criticized Helfrich numerous times on this site about his coaching and play calling decisions. So using your dot connecting approach, what type of racist am I? For me, I see head coaches, not skin color and my comments reflect that whether you believe it or not.\n\nPerhaps you saw the game and Taggart's coaching style from a different perspective and that is fine.

In the grand scheme of things, reducing our carbon footprint as individuals is insignificant. The bond needs to be broken between the federal and state governments and the fossil fuel giants. If we can get policy passed that cuts subsidies to fossil fuel companies and promotes subsidizing or exploring renewable energy, the economic incentive will be there for the technology to expand and we will reach a point where jets, and other vehicles can be run on renewable energy sooner. Vote against bills that would allow new pipelines/more fossil fuel extraction and exploration.

4181,"""\n\n edits in Jan., 2012 \n\nThank you for recently updating this article. I hope you continue. This article has had many adverse edits in the past and I try to keep it within Wikipedia's standards.\n\nIf a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that """"the sky is blue"""", or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.\n\nSources should be secondary, meaning at least one level removed from personal experience. Usually, that means an independent third-party reliable source. By contrast, for example, SA's website is a primary source about SA. Self-statements are primary sources. Primary sources are allowed but must be used with greater care and generally should be shunned (except in the External Links section, for example). Try to find secondary sources wherever possible. Part of Wikipedia's standard is at WP:PSTS.\n\nThe lede (sometimes spelled """"lead"""") should be a summary of the body of the article, so it doesn't get a reference. Because the lede is a summary, any statement in the lede should essentially be in the body, too, so the reference should be positioned where the body's statement is.\n\nA tendency to write an article like an advertisement sometimes crops up. The recent edits to this article were mild in that regard; I've seen a much more obvious case recently in another article. While this school network has remarkable achievements that should be described, legitimately sourced criticisms also have to be included or preserved. Articles that are too much like ads are subject to severe rewritings or reversions to earlier revisions, often by editors less familiar with the subject.\n\nRef elements generally follow punctuation. For example, we'd write, """"This is a fact,Source A. and this is another fact.Source B.""""\n\nImages need alt texts, so that people who are blind or visually impaired can have their browsers read aloud information about a picture. The old image also lacked an alt text for a long time and now I've added one (I could have long ago but didn't get to it). If you create a new image and add it, please add an alt text with it.\n\nThank you again for your work.   """,0

He's added more taxes on alcohol to the middle class.  Get a grip. This is not a government that has shown any interest in protecting the rights and pocketbooks of Canadians.

For AC resistance is replaced with impedance (z) which involves the resistance as well as capacitance and inductance. For long distance transmission of electricity DC is favored because there is less capacitive and inductive loss and because there is no need to synchronize as in AC. DC voltage changes are less efficient than AC with a transformer so that need to be part of the consideration.\nFor low current solid state devices the use of 12-36 volts could use in a circuit for such device.

2728,"""\n\nThe WWW.\nWeird World of Wikipedia\n\nBy Martin J. Walker\nFebruary 2006\n\nWith this in mind, most people dealing with this issue, attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is `situated' knowledge, and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint. This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100% ‚Äòneutral‚Äô or ‚Äòobjective‚Äô, and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be `objective` (especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour).\n\nAngela Kennedy & Jane Bryant, The One Click Group to Jimmy Wales. \n17 November 2005.\nhttp://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/More%20Wikipedia%20On%20Wessely.doc\n\nOne Click seems to me to be a bunch of paranoid zealots. And I   will state again that before I tried to tone down the shit they put on the Wessely page I had never heard of them or Simon Wessely.\n Just Z  G, you know? [T]/[C] AfD? 15:46, \n19 December 2005\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Wessely\n\nA conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250,000 in the UK, yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession, is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents, is seldom accepted by medical research workers, and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies. \n\nTABSince 1986, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‚Äòfalse illness beliefs‚Äô, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. \n\nTABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King‚Äôs College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‚Äòquackbuster‚Äô organisations. \n\nTABJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely‚Äôs psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely‚Äôs role in the politics of ME. \n\nTABWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ‚Äòedit police‚Äô who cruise the pages seeking ‚Äòvandalism‚Äô and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia‚Äôs self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‚ÄòJimbo‚Äô Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. \n\nAlthough Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‚Äòbehavioural problems‚Äô, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‚Äòanything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.‚Äô Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. \n\nTABWhen, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality ‚Äì ‚Äòwe are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute‚Äô - the debate entered another level.\n\nTABIt seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know? (Clearly I have no intention of using this onanistic sobriquet in this essay and so will refer to him as ZG)\n\nTABThere ensued an argument, about One Click‚Äôs contribution to the Wessely entry, which though handled with cool clear minded determ",0

14263,Coercion like collusion is not illegal.  Granting or withholding support for another politician's priorities is one of the most common ways deals are made on legislation - it is a central pillar of the democratic process.  And don't cite the convictions in Bridgegate as an example otherwise - those people were convicted of misapplying federal funds (i.e. intentionally obstructing use of a federally funded highway)  and the conspiracy to do so (the violation of law had nothing to do with the fact that it was political retaliation).,0

4524,"Numbers don't lie, but you can certainly lie with numbers and tell half-truths too.\n\nChina spending lots on clean generation. India generating 57% of power in ten years from clean sources?  Very clever putting these two items together.  China has 2BN people and will spend $300BN on energy.  India must be doing that too!!  Well, no.  India generates very little power for a nation of 2BN people, mostly from coal like China.  The difference is India will be adding generating power, both coal and renewables from a very low base.  China will be converting away from coal.  It is not the same thing.\n\nUse of renewables does require storage solutions to take full advantage.  All of these are either experimental or (batteries) very expensive.  You can purchase a Tesla storage solution for home.  You will be shocked at how little power storage you get for the price.  The payback period to break even vs. just purchasing power is very long.  \n\nThe article is silent on price for a reason.",1

Then there's this: \nIn 1866, one former slave at Arlington House, Wesley Norris, gave his testimony to the National Anti-Slavery Standard. Mr. Norris said that he and others at Arlington were indeed told by Mr. Custis they would be freed upon his death, but that Lee had told them to stay for five more years.\n\nSo Mr. Norris said he, a sister and a cousin tried to escape in 1859, but were caught. ‚ÄúWe were tied firmly to posts by a Mr. Gwin, our overseer, who was ordered by Gen. Lee to strip us to the waist and give us fifty lashes each, excepting my sister, who received but twenty,‚Äù he said.\n\nAnd when the overseer declined to wield the lash, a constable stepped up, Mr. Norris said.

West Eugene north of 11th has large swaths of existing medium and high density residential housing. More is currently under construction and on the drawing boards for construction. Many of these areas, especially new ones are within walking distance of this new line. The West 11th corridor has no land area potential to handle future capacity for expanded West eugene residential development and the huge proposed Veneta expansion.
